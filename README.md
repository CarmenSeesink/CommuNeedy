<!--PROJECT DESCRIPTION-->
## Project Description

![image1][image1]

The current COVID-19 pandemic has left members in our community in need. These members are feeling hopeless as they have no means to provide for their basic needs such as food, water, hygiene and transportation.

At the same time there are privileged members that want to donate money to uplift these communities. Unfortunately, there is a gap in communication between these opposing communities.
